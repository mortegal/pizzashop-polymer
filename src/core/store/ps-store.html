<!-- 
    An HTMLElement cannot be singleton since every time
    we use it in the DOM a new instance will be created,
    therefore, if we wan't to manage the app state from
    one point, we must implement the monostate patter.

    The monostate pattern consist on creating an instance
    of the element the first time it is created, and storing the
    state into that instance, which in this case will be available
    in a clousure.

    We will create a store that will contain all the state of
    our app, inside an object called state, where users will
    be able to record and read data.

    If we want users of the store to get notified about changes
    we need to use the observer pattern, and with the help of
    Polymer data system it is not so hard.

    We will create a mixin that will implement our specific stores
    and that mixin will register them as subscribers of the instance
    on the connectedCallback and unregister them on the disconnectedCallback.

    Every time a subscriber is registered, we store a reference to it so we
    can later notify it about changes, and we will give it an initial reference
    to the current state.

    Whenever there is a change on the state, we will notify all subscribers with
    the path of the change, and if they are observing that specific change, then
    the notification will take effect.

    For updating the state property a specific store is using, they must first
    get a reference to that state by creating a ps-store instance and binding
    to the state property, with a one-way data binding, later they can call
    `this.set('state.propertypath', value)` to update its own reference and propagate
    the changes to the store.
